Package to collect tax receipt data from SEFAZ-RS.

<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/KxtMLfh8k8GEJHpBVi/giphy.gif" align="right" padding-left = "10 px" width = "30%"/>

For now the package only collects data from the link generated by the QR in the tax receipts.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("fcsest/shopper", force = T)
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(shopper)

image_example <- "https://github.com/fcsest/shopper/inst/app/www/example.png"

# Read QR Code of impressed receipt 
my_df <- get_qrcode_text(image) %>% 
  get_sefaz_rs_rdata()
```
